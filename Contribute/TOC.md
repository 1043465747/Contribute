## Creating new content
   <!--
     This page introduces the process to work locally on
     your own machine, following github flow.

     Content will be taken from the last two sections of
     how-to-contribute.md (writing new samples, and creating new content)
     and the how-to-write-workflows-major.md)
### Setup and Clone Source
   <!--
      This page will guide folks through the setup process
      through cloning the repo.

      It will have condensed versions of get-started-setup-github,
      get-started-setup-tools, and get-started-setup-local.
### Git and GitHub Essentials
   <!--
      Explain the basics of Git and GitHub, and the GitHub flow
      process.

      Much, or all of this will be from full-workflow, and git-github-fundamentals

      The full list of repos probably doesn't belong here.
### Contribute New Topics
   <!--
     Primarily new content, but will include the content from the
     how-to-write-use-markdown, style-quick-start and how-to-write-links

     Process content will also be taken from how-to-contribute.
#### Content Types
#### Markdown Resources
#### Tone, Voice, and Style
### Contribute New Samples
   <!--
     Primarily new content, with some taken from how-to-contribute.

     This will also point to repo-specific guidance for samples.

     We have an important decision to make here: This contributing guide
     can contain the union of all code style rules for all different languages
     and frameworks, or it can contain the intersection (code samples must
     compile and run).

     I'm in favor of the former: Everyone writing Python should follow the Python
     guidance; everyone writing C# should follow the C# rules. Those should be 
     consistent regardless of the project team.
## List of Documentation Repositories -->
   <!-- 
     This will take the list of repos from git-github-fundamentals
     for the public repositories.

     Open question: How to keep this up to date?
